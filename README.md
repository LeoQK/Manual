## How It Works

### Core Belief

Video games are considered entertainment technology for consumer play. But in our complex world, games and gamers have vast potential to contribute to enterprise decision-making. We believe that gaming skillsets can be critical assets to organizations in tackling the complex problems of our world. 

Playing difficult games like [StarCraft II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_II:_Wings_of_Liberty) or [Dark Souls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls) means training problem-solving skills that are valuable in the real world. Building coherent strategies from limited data, adapting to new events at the needed speed, and decomposing your own performance to thrive in environments with low feedback are some of the skills gamers have honed. The challenge is how gamers can transfer these skills to real-world problems and careers.

### What We Do

Leading organizations have started to [hire gamers](https://www.businessinsider.com/retired-gamer-offered-internship-for-past-starcraft-2-performance-2019-10) for their problem-solving skills. But there exist no tools that would enable the interaction between gamers and organizations to intensify and scale. 

With Mapcontrol, we aim to build these tools and empower gaming for enterprise:

* **Gaming skills** - Nuanced documentation of the skills that a game like StarCraft II trains
* **Skill transferability** - Clear guidelines on how gaming skills can be transferred to real-world problems
* **Presentation and assessment** - Best practices for the presentation and assessment of gaming skills in interviews

### Where We're Going

As we engage with the gaming community and organizations, we will release research on gaming skills, skill transferability, and presentation and assessment. We also strive to apply our knowledge to coach gamers seeking career growth.

## Collaboration and Coaching

Gaming is all about community. So is gaming for enterprise. We want to collaborate with and learn from gamers and organizations to advance the application of gaming skills to enterprise.
