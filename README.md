## Gaming for Enterprise

Playing difficult games like StarCraft II or Dark Souls means training problem-solving skills that are valuable for the real world. 
Building coherent strategies from limited data, adapting to new events at the needed speed, and decomposing your own performance to thrive in environments with low feedback are some of the skills gamers have honed. 

The decision-making skills that these games trains are valuable in the real world. Skills like building coherent strategies from limited data and then adapting them as new information becomes available are at the core of some positions in business development or strategy.
