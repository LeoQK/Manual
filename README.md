## Gaming for enterprise

Playing difficult games like [StarCraft II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_II:_Wings_of_Liberty) or [Dark Souls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls) means training problem-solving skills that are valuable in the real world. Building coherent strategies from limited data, adapting to new events at the needed speed, and decomposing your own performance to thrive in environments with low feedback are some of the skills gamers have honed. The challenge is how gamers can transfer these skills to real-world problems and careers. 

Leading organizations have started to [hire gamers](https://www.businessinsider.com/retired-gamer-offered-internship-for-past-starcraft-2-performance-2019-10) for their problem-solving skills. But there exist no tools that would enable the interaction between gamers and organizations to intensify and scale. 

The tools needed to match gamers and organizations are:

* Nuanced documentation of the skills that a game like StarCraft II trains
* Clear guidelines on how gaming skills can be transferred to real-world problems
* Best practices for the presentation and assessment of gaming skills in interviews

With Mapcontrol, we aim to build these tools and empower gaming for enterprise.
